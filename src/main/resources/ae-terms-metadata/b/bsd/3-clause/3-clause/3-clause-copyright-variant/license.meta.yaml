# FIXME-DISCUSS: the copyright holder variant should not be limited to copyright holders only. Derive policy:
# 1. we differentiate (generally) templates to match external sources (scancode, spdx, ...)
# 2. we differentiate variants with deviating text
# 3. within acceptable text variations we allow expression matches
# JIRA-TASK created: AE-1260

# FIXME-Concept: For a given alternative name; a fixed variable set must be defined
