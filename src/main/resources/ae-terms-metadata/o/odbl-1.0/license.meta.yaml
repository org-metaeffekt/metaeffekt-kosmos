    - "Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual
       material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so the ODbL
       only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database
       individually"
    - "Licensors should use the ODbL together with another license for the contents,
       if the contents have a single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents"
    - "If the contents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should describe what
       rights govern what contents together in the individual record or in some other way that
       clarifies what rights apply"
