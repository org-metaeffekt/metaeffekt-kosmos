## Substructures

### License folders
Each license consists of a minimum of a single file called license.meta.yaml.
In this file all information digested from a license or a group of licenses is aggregated.

### .meta folders
In addition, a "license" folder, containing the license text and a ".meta" folder can be present.
The **".meta"** folder contains runtime information.

## Examples:

The Apache License 2.0 can be found under:

    ae-terms-metadata > a > apache > 2.0

The Classpath Exception can be found under:

    ae-terms-metadata > _exceptions > classpath-exception

## Conventions

### Folder structure conventions

The folder structure follows certain conventions:
* all lower case; use '-' to separate different name parts.
* Organise folder by the first letter
* Organise Terms Metadata by provider and version if several versions exist; e.g. check structure in license-metadata/a/apache

### `canonicalName` conventions

* Variants are expressed in the canonicalName either by adding a modifier in brackets or by numbering a variant (var-001)

### `combinedWith` conventions
* Exceptions use ...
