       to the attribution requirements set out in Section 4"
    - "Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images, audiovisual
       material, and sounds all in the same database, for example), and so this license
       only governs the rights over the Database, and not the contents of the Database
       individually"

       for the contents"
    - "Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered
       by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts, trademark over
       the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights over information in the
       contents), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents
       or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this License"
