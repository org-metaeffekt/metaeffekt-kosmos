       non-exclusive, non-transferable limited license to reproduce, prepare Enterprise Derivative Works
       (as defined below) of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Redpanda Enterprise

       licensable by Licensor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of
       their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted"

       lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
       contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
       shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed"

       Redpanda Enterprise Edition"

       to all other terms and conditions set forth in the License provided with or contained in such Third Party Works"

       employees and individual contractors) to access the functionality of Redpanda Enterprise Edition by
       performing an action directly or indirectly that causes the creation of a topic in the Work"
    - "For clarity, a Streaming or Queuing Service would include providers of infrastructure services, such as cloud
       services, hosting services, data center services and similarly situated third parties (including affiliates of
       such entities) that would offer Redpanda Enterprise Edition in connection with a broader service offering to
       customers or subscribers of such of such third party’s core services"
