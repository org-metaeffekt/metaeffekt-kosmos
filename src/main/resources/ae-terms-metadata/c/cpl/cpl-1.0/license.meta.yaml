       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
       reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
       distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
       such derivative works, in source code and object code form"
    - "Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
       Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
       transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
       object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
       Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by
       the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination
       to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to
       any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
       licensed hereunder"
    - "Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses
       to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
       Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
       intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
       any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
       infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
       exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
       assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
       needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
       allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
       to acquire that license before distributing the Program"
    - "Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
       copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
       set forth in this Agreement"
    - "Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program"
    - "If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
       a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
       lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient
       under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed"
