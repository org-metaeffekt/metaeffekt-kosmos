         combination of the RPSL (for Covered Code) and a Compatible Source License for
         any independently developed software modules within the Derivative Work. The
         foregoing requirement applies even if the Compatible Source License would
         ordinarily allow the software module to link with, or form larger works with,
         other software that is not subject to the Compatible Source License. For
         example, although the Mozilla Public License v1.1 allows Mozilla code to be
         combined with proprietary software that is not subject to the MPL, if
         MPL-licensed code is used with Covered Code the MPL-licensed code could not be
         combined or linked with any code not governed by the MPL"
