    - "The existent copyleft licensing models were designed to protect the value of the
       code which is created in open source projects. They make sure anyone who builds
       on top of this code also releases their code under the same copyleft license,
       thus sharing back with the community and the developers of the original project
       the added value of the derived work"
    - "Copyleft licenses however were created long before crypto currency and
       blockchain technologies appeared, and could not have anticipated the fact that
       today the value of an open source distributed ledger project is contained not
       only in the program code being written, but in the unique public blockchain
       instance or crypto currency token, maintained by this project, with its
       developers, community and holders sharing the common interest to preserve and
       increase the value of this blockchain token"
    - "Crypto currency tokens are also an inseparable part of each distributed ledger
       software, without which such software cannot really be used. Ensuring that a
       clone project shares back the modified source code is no longer sufficient to
       allow the users of the original project access to that derived work, unless they
       are also allocated some of the newly created tokens in the clone blockchain
       instance. Thus such allocation is important in order to preserve not only the
       value of the original tokens, but also to preserve the users freedom to use any
       works derived from the original software"
