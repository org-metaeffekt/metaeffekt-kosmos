    -   "The GNU LGPL applies to the CUPS and CUPS Imaging libraries
         located in the \"cups\" and \"filter\" subdirectories of the CUPS
         source distribution and the files in the \"test\" subdirectory. The
         GNU GPL applies to the remainder of the CUPS distribution.
  
         For those not familiar with the GNU GPL, the license basically
         allows you to:
  
            - Use the CUPS software at no charge.
            - Distribute verbatim copies of the software in source or
              binary form.
            - Sell verbatim copies of the software for a media fee, or
              sell support for the software.
  
         What this license *does not* allow you to do is make changes or
         add features to CUPS and then sell a binary distribution without
         source code. You must provide source for any changes or additions
         to the software, and all code must be provided under the GPL or
         LGPL as appropriate. The only exceptions to this are the portions
         of the CUPS software covered by the Apple operating system
         license exceptions outlined later in this license agreement.
  
         The GNU LGPL relaxes the \"link-to\" restriction, allowing you to
         develop applications that use the CUPS and CUPS Imaging libraries
         under other licenses and/or conditions as appropriate for your
         application, driver, or filter"
