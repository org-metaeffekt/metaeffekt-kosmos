  - "Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

     If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
     use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
     which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

     To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
     them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
     of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a
     pointer to where the full notice is found.

     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright
