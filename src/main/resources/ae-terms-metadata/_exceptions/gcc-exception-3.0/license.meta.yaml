evidence:
  matches:
    - "When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program"
    - "The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception"
    - "A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library"
    - "The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in a high-level, non-intermediate language into Target Code"
    - "Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors"
    - "You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes"
