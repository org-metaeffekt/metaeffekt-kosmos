# FIXME-DISCUSS: Our "ECMA License" is the same as "ECMAScript Language Specification 5.1 (ECMA-262)" which can be found online. Do we want to adjust the naming of this license to be more specific or keep it vague? What is right here?

alternativeNames:
  - "ECMA License"
  - "Ecma-262 Edition 5.1"
  - "The ECMAScript Language Specification 5.1"
