  "<lq>This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use the software,
   you accept this license. If you do not accept the license, do not use the
   software.
   <p>1. Definitions</p>
   <p>The terms \"reproduce,\" \"reproduction,\" \"derivative works,\" and \"distribution\"
    have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.</p>
    <p>A \"contribution\" is the original software, or any additions or changes to
    the software.</p>
    <p>A \"contributor\" is any person that distributes its contribution under this
    license.</p>
    <p>\"Licensed patents\" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on
    its contribution.</p>
    <p>2. Grant of Rights</p>
    <p>(A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
    conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive,
    worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare
    derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its contribution or any
    derivative works that you create.</p>
    <p>(B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
    conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive,
    worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make, have made,
    use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution
    in the software or derivative works of the contribution in the software.</p>
    <p>3. Conditions and Limitations</p>
    <p>(A) Reciprocal Grants- For any file you distribute that contains code from
    the software (in source code or binary format), you must provide recipients
    the source code to that file along with a copy of this license, which license
    will govern that file. You may license other files that are entirely your
    own work and do not contain code from the software under any terms you choose.</p>
    <p>(B) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any
    contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.</p>
    <p>(C) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that
    you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor
    to the software ends automatically.</p>
    <p>(D) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all copyright,
    patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software.</p>
    <p>(E) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you
    may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license
    with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled
    or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with
    this license.</p>
    (F) The software is licensed \"as-is.\" You bear the risk of using it. The contributors
    give no express warranties, guarantees, or conditions. You may have additional
    consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot change. To
    the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors exclude the implied
    warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</lq>"
