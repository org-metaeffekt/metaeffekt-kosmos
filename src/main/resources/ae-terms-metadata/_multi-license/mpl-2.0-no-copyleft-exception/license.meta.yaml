comments:
  - "This expression is modelled as reaction to the SPDX identifier MPL-2.0-no-copyleft-exception, only. The
     baseline license is the MPL-2.0 in its original form. Whether the source code is incompatible with secondary
     licenses is usage context (and therefore regarded an expression). In addition, SPDX seems to have missinterpreted
     Exhibit B. The conclusion that Exhibit B would cause the copyleft exception of the license is not shared."
