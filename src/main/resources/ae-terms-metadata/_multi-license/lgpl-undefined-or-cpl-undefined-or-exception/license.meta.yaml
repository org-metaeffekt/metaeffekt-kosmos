# FIXME-CONCEPT: this expression needs to be referenced in one of the listed licenses. Doing that results in the whole expression getting matched even if just 2 of the listed licenses get matched. This is due to combiner logic which cannot handle more than 2 licenses being combined. (see combinedWith in: LZMA SDK Version Exception)
