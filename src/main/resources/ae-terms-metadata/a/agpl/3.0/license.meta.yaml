    - "The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
       software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
       cooperation with the community in the case of network server software"
    - "The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
       to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
       our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
       share and change all versions of a program*{.{0,6}}*to make sure it remains free
       software for all its users"
    - "When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
       price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
       have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
       them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
       want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
       free programs, and that you know you can do these things"
    - "Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
       with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
       you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
       and/or modify the software"
    - "A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
       improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
       receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
       incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
       encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
       software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
       The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
       letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
       source code to the public"
    - "The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
       ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
       to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
       provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
       users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
       a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
       code of the modified version"

       published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
