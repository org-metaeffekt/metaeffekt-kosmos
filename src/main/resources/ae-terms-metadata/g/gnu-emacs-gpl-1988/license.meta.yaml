    - "Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
       away copies of Emacs, that you receive source code or else can get it
       if you want it, that you can change Emacs or use pieces of it in new
       free programs, and that you know you can do these things"
    - "To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
       deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
       copies of Emacs, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
       have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
       source code.  And you must tell them their rights"
    - "Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone
       finds out that there is no warranty for GNU Emacs.  If Emacs is
       modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know
       that what they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems
       introduced by others will not reflect on our reputation"
