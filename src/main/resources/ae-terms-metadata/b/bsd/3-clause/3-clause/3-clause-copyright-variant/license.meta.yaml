shortName: BSD-3-Clause-copyright-holder

# FIXME-CONCEPT / FIXME-DISCUSS: how can we model the BSD 3-Clause License and the BSD 3-Clause License (copyright holder variant) to not match each other while also not having to use heaps of excludes. - how to solve elegantly?
# The copyright holder variant should not only cover variants that explicitly state "copyright holder" in the license text but also variants that state the company or organisation name themselves.
