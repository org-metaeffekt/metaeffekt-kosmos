As a special exception, The Free Software Foundation gives
permission for additional uses of the text contained in his release
of ServerHandler.

The exception is that, if you link the ServerHandler library with other
files to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the
resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public License.
Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on account of
linking the ServerHandler library code into it.

This exception does not however invalidate any other reasons why
the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.

This exception applies only to the code released by The Free
Software Foundation under the name ServerHandler.  If you copy code
from other sources under the General Public License into a copy of
ServerHandler, as the General Public License permits, the exception
does not apply to the code that you add in this way.  To avoid
misleading anyone as to the status of such modified files, you must
delete this exception notice from them.

If you write modifications of your own for ServerHandler, it is your
choice whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.
If you do not wish that, delete this exception notice.
