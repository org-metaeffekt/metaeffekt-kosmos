      - "However to be able to use and link against libgnutls a program needs to be
         available under a license compatible with LGPLv3+ or GPLv2+ since GnuTLS
         requires nettle which requires GMP. GMP (>= 6.0.0) is dual licensed
         LGPLv3+ or GPLv2+. Starting with 3.5.7 libunistring is needed, too. It also
         is dual licensed LGPLv3+ or GPLv2+ (libunistring 0.9.7 and above, earlier
         version were LGPLv3+ only.)"
