         PREAMBLE

         The GNU General Public License provides a legal guarantee that
         software covered by it remains free (in the sense of freedom, not
         price).  It achieves this guarantee by imposing obligations on anyone
         who chooses to distribute the software."
      - "This Licence applies to any Program or other work which contains a
         notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
         under the terms of this Unmodified Binary Distribution Licence.  All
         terms used in the text of this Licence are to be interpreted as they
         are used in version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published
         by the Free Software Foundation"
      - "when started running, the Program must display an announcement which
           includes the details of your existing publication of the Program
           made in accordance with the terms of the GNU General Public License.
           For example, the Program could display the URL of the publicly
           available source code from which the Unmodified Binary was built"
      - "This Licence allows for the distribution of unmodified binaries built
         from publicly available source code, without imposing the obligations
         of the GNU General Public License upon anyone who chooses to
         distribute only the unmodified binaries built from that source code.

         The extra permissions granted by this Licence apply only to unmodified
         binaries built from source code which has already been made available
         to the public in accordance with the terms of the GNU General Public
         Licence.  Nothing in this Licence allows for the creation of
         closed-source modified versions of the Program.  Any modified versions
         of the Program are subject to the usual terms and conditions of the
         GNU General Public License."
      - "This Licence applies to any Program or other work which contains a
         notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
         under the terms of this Unmodified Binary Distribution Licence.  All
         terms used in the text of this Licence are to be interpreted as they
         are used in version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published
         by the Free Software Foundation."
      - "If you have made this Program available to the public in both source
         code and executable form in accordance with the terms of the GNU
         General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation;
         either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
         version, then you are hereby granted an additional permission to use,
         copy, and distribute the unmodified executable form of this Program
         (the \"Unmodified Binary\") without restriction, including the right to
          permit persons to whom the Unmodified Binary is furnished to do
          likewise, subject to the following conditions"
