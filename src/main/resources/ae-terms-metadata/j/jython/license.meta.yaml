        "JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the primary developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw took over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1. In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge where it was renamed to Jython. Jython 2.0 and 2.1 were developed under the Jython specific license below. From the 2.2 release on, Jython contributors have signed Python Software Foundation contributor agreements and releases are covered under the Python Software Foundation license version 2. The standard library is covered by the Python Software Foundation license as well. See the Lib/LICENSE file for details. The zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed under the GNU Public License. The package is now covered by the Jython Software License. The command line interpreter is covered by the Apache Software License. See the org/apache/LICENSE file for details."
