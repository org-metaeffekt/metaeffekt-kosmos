# FIXME-IMPLEMENT: after fixing the segmentation issue (caused by the hyphens) in the code fix the following:
## 1: Fix the segmentation (mappings).
## 2: See which licenses get matched and adjust ignoreMatches/expectedMatches and the expectedSpdxMatches, as well as the displayName accordingly.
# FIXME-CONCEPT: see Jira: "AEU-148"
# these should create new segments, but they don't. probably another hyphen issue.
