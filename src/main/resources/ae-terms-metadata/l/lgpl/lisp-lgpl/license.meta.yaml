    - "The concept of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
       (\"LGPL\") has been adopted to govern the use and distribution of above-
        mentioned application"
    - "However, the LGPL uses terminology that is more
       appropriate for a program written in C than one written in Lisp"
    - "A \"Library\" in Lisp is a collection of Lisp functions, data and foreign
        modules"
    - "The form of the Library can be Lisp source code (for processing
       by an interpreter) or object code (usually the result of compilation of
       source code or built with some other mechanisms)"
    - "Foreign modules are
       object code in a form that can be linked into a Lisp executable"
    - "The Library consists of everything in the distribution file set before
       any modifications are made to the files"
    - "If any of the functions or
       classes in the Library are redefined in other files, then those
       redefinitions ARE considered a work based on the Library"
    - "It is permitted to add proprietary source code to the Library, but it
       must be done in a way such that the Library will still run without that
       proprietary code present"

      - "Section 5 of the LGPL distinguishes between
         the case of a library being dynamically linked at runtime and one being
         statically linked at build time"
      -  "Section 5 of the LGPL states that the
         former results in an executable that is a \"work that uses the Library.\"
          Section 5 of the LGPL states that the latter results in one that is a
          \"derivative of the Library\", which is therefore covered by the LGPL"
      -   "Since Lisp only offers one choice, which is to link the Library into an
          executable at build time, we declare that, for the purpose applying the
          LGPL to the Library, an executable that results from linking a \"work
          that uses the Library\" with the Library is considered a \"work that uses
          the Library\" and is therefore NOT covered by the LGPL."
      -   "Because of this declaration, section 6 of LGPL is not applicable to the
          Library. However, in connection with each distribution of this
          executable, you must also deliver, in accordance with the terms and
          conditions of the LGPL, the source code of Library (or your derivative
          thereof) that is incorporated into this executable."
