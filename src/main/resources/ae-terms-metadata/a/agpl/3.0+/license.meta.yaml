    - "How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

         If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
       possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
       free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

         To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
       to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
       state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
       the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
        the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
        (at your option) any later version.

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
