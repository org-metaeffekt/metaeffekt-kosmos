    Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here
    is a summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this package:

    The following command may be helpful in finding per-file license
    information. It works on xz.git and on a clean file tree extracted
    from a release tarball.

        sh build-aux/license-check.sh -v

    A note about old XZ Utils releases:

        XZ Utils releases 5.4.6 and older and 5.5.1alpha have a
        significant amount of code put into the public domain and
        that obviously remains so. The switch from public domain to
        0BSD for newer releases was made in Febrary 2024 because
        public domain has (real or perceived) legal ambiguities in
        some jurisdictions.

        There is very little *practical* difference between public
        domain and 0BSD. The main difference likely is that one
        shouldn't claim that 0BSD-licensed code is in the public
        domain; 0BSD-licensed code is copyrighted but available under
        an extremely permissive license. Neither 0BSD nor public domain
        require retaining or reproducing author, copyright holder, or
        license notices when distributing the software. (Compare to,
        for example, BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" License which does have
        such requirements.)
