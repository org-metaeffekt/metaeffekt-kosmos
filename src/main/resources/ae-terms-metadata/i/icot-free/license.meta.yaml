    - "The Institute for New Generation Computer Technology ('ICOT')
       had been promoting the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project under
       the commitment of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry of
       Japan (the 'MITI').  Since April 1993, ICOT has been promoting the
       Follow-on project to the FGCS project. This follow-on project aims to
       disseminate and further develop FGCS technology. The FGCS project and
       the Follow-on project (collectively, the 'Project') have been aimed at
       creating basic technology for novel computers that realizes parallel
       inference processing as their core mechanism, and contributing toward
       the progress of computer science by sharing innovative knowledge and
       technology with the research community worldwide"
    - "Innovative hardware and software parallel inference technology
       has been under development through the Project, which involves
       varieties of advanced software for experiments and evaluation. This
       software, being at a basic stage of research and development, should
       be disseminated widely to the research community"
    - "According to the aims of the Project, ICOT has made this
       software, the copyright of which does not belong to the government but
       to ICOT itself, available to the public in order to contribute to the
       world, and, moreover, has removed all restrictions on its usage that
       may have impeded further research and development in order that large
       numbers of researchers can use it freely to begin a new era of
       computer science"
    - "This program together with any attached documentation (collec-
       tively, the 'Program') is being distributed by ICOT free of charge as
       ICOT Free Software"
    - "Persons wanting to use the Program ('Users') may freely do so
       and may also freely modify and copy the Program. The term 'modify,' as
       used here, includes, but is not limited to, any act to improve or
       expand the Program for the purposes of enhancing and/or improving its
       function, performance and/or quality as well as to add one or more
       programs or documents developed by Users of the Program"
