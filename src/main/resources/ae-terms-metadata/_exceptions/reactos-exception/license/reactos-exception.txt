ReactOS may be used, runtime linked, and distributed with non-free software
(meaning that such software has no obligations to open-source, or render
free, their non-free code) such as commercial device drivers and commercial
applications. This exception does not alter any other responsibilities of
the licensee under the GPL (meaning that such software must still obey
the GPL for the free ("open-sourced") code that has been integrated into
