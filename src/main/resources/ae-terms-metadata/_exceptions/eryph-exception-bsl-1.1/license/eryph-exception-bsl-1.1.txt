                      The Licensed Work is (c) 2025 dbosoft GmbH
Additional Use Grant: You may use one single server instance of the
                      Licensed Work for any purpose and you may
                      concurrently use multiple single server instances of
                      the Licensed Work in isolation, subject to each of
                      the following conditions: (a) you may not cluster any
                      instances of the Licensed Work together for
                      one use and (b) you may not use the Licensed Work
                      for a "Compute Service". A “Compute Service” is a
                      commercial offering that allows third parties (other
                      than your employees and contractors) to access the
                      functionality of the Licensed Work by creating virtual
                      machines that are controlled by such third parties.
