# FIXME-RESEARCH / FIXME-CONCEPT: the first match of "GNU Free Documentation License 1.1 (invariants) and the equivalent evidence in GNU Free Documentation License 1.1 (no invariants) match with each other even though they are different. This is critical since that is the only difference in the two licenses. For some reason they don't match with each other when being matched across sentences as one big evidence like this (they also can't exclude each other) :
#  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1; with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU Free Documentation License\""
