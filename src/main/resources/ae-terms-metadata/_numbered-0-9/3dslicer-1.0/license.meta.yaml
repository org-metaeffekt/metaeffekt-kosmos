# FIXME-CONCEPT: putting the whole license text into the license workbench and running it returns no result at all (no report etc.). No masks were found that could cause this issue.
#   the issue probably has to do with the following sentence: "If your Contribution is protected by patent, you hereby grant to Brigham, with the right to sublicense, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license under your interest in patent rights covering the Contribution, to make, have made, use, sell and otherwise transfer your Contribution, alone or in combination with any other code."
