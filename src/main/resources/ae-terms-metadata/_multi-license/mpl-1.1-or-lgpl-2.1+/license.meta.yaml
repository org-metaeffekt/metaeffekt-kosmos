# workaround to make evidence and license text work because this is a multi-license expression: if we want this to follow our convention evidence and license text should be deleted.
# FIXME-DISCUSS: evidence with license text has been added do avoid a lot of incomplete matches. There should be a better way to handle this - implement new feature etc.?
