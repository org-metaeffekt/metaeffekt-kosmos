    - "You may distribute the Program or a Derivative Work in object code or
       executable form under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 provided that you
       also do one of the following"
    - "Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
       which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2; or"
    - "Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
       give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
       source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
       source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 on
       a medium customarily used for software interchange; or"
    - "Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
       corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
       distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable
       form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection 3.3(b)(2) above.)"
    - "The source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
       distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
       kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
       that component itself accompanies the executable code"
    - "If distribution of executable code or object code is made by offering
       access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
       copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
       code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along
       with the object code"
    - "Each time you redistribute the Program or any Derivative Work, the recipient
       automatically receives a license from 3dfx and successor licensors to copy,
       distribute or modify the Program and Derivative Works subject to the terms
       and conditions of the License. You may not impose any further restrictions
       on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
       for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License"
    - "You may not make any use of the GLIDE trademark without the prior written
       permission of 3dfx"
    - "You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program or any
       Derivative Works except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
       otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program or any Derivative
       Works is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
       However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
       License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain
       in full compliance"
