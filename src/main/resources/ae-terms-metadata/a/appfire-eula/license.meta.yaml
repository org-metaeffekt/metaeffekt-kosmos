    - "The Products are licensed, not sold, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms
       in this EULA such as “purchase” or “sale”"
    - "For other than No-Charge Products, the Licensor grants you a perpetual (subject to termination for breach),
       worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub licensable license to install and use the Software in object
       code only, limited to the Scope of Use as designated in your Order"
    - "The Licensor grants you a monthly (paid in advance) subscription for worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
       non-sub licensable use of the Hosted Services, subject to automatic renewal for successive monthly terms unless
       either Licensor or you notifies the other of non-renewal or Licensor ceases to make a particular Hosted Service
       available. If you cancel, your subscription will terminate at the end of the then-current billing cycle, but you
       will not be entitled to any credits or refunds for amounts accrued or paid prior to such termination. You
       acknowledge that Hosted Services are on-line, subscription-based products, hosted by Licensor and/or Atlassian,
       and that Licensor and/or Atlassian may make changes to the Hosted Services from time to time"
    - "The Licensor may offer you a time-limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable limited
       license for certain Products at no charge, including free accounts, trial use, and access to Beta Versions as
       defined below (“No-Charge Products”). Your use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms specified
       by Licensor and is only permitted for the evaluation period designated by Licensor. After the evaluation period
       is expired you must abide by the Standard Use rights, or must remove and delete all copies of the Software in
       your possession. You may not use No-Charge Products for competitive analysis or similar purposes. Licensor may
       terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion, without
       liability to you. You understand that any pre-release and beta products (“Beta Versions”) are still under
       development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally
       available Products. Licensor makes no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available. In
       some circumstances, Licensor may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta
       Versions will still remain subject to this paragraph. All information regarding the characteristics, features or
       performance of Beta Versions constitutes Licensor’s Confidential Information. To the maximum extent permitted by
       applicable law, Licensor disclaims all obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including
       any Support Services, warranty, and indemnity obligations"
    - "Your license rights under this EULA are non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable. You may not sell,
       transfer or convey the Software to any third party without Licensor’s prior express written consent. Licensor
       reserves all rights not expressly granted to the Licensee in this EULA"
    - "Standard Use licensees are permitted to make one (1) copy of the Software for data protection, archiving and
       backup purposes only and for no other purpose"
    - "You may only install the Software and make the Software available for use on hardware systems owned, leased or
       controlled by you, or your third party service providers so long as you remain responsible for their compliance
       with the terms and conditions of this EULA"
    - "This EULA applies whether you purchase Products directly from Licensor, through the Atlassian marketplace,
       through an authorized Reseller or otherwise. If you purchase through a Reseller, your license rights shall be
       as stated in the Order placed by Reseller for you, and the Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such
       Order. Resellers are not authorized to make any promises or commitments on Licensor’s behalf, and Licensor is
       not bound by any obligations to you other than what is included in this EULA"
