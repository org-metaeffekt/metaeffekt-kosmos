# FIXME-CONCEPT: spelling mistake in the license text "TORTUOUS" has been changed to "TORTIOUS" because of a mapping in
#   a different license. I had to find this out myself by testing word for word because the license did not match,
#   which was time-consuming. !Viewer for all mappings/masks needed with search feature or a tool/notification which
#   tells us if/what masks etc. have been applied from which location (file)!
