                 0BSD for newer releases was made in Febrary 2024 because

                 domain and 0BSD. The main difference likely is that one
                 shouldn't claim that 0BSD-licensed code is in the public
                 domain"

                 license notices when distributing the software. (Compare to,
                 for example, BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" License which does have
          such requirements.)"
