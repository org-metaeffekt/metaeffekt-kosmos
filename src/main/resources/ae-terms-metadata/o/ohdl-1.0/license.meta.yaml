# FIXME-CONCEPT: segmentation revert is broken by -------- (runs of hyphens/minuses); same issue in "MVT License 1.1"; change behaviour of segmentation revert, so that including runs of minuses does not break revert anymore;  - current solution: delete all hyphens at beginning of "matchNext" string to solve!

Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Hardware Description due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.

In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.",
