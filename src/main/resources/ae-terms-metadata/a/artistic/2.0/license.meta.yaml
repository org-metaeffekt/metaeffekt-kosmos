licenseTemplate: "<lq>Preamble
                  <p>This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package
                  may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is
                  that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development
                  of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and
                  free software.</p>
                  <p>You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license
                  directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this
                  license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package,
                  you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.</p>
                  <p>General Provisions</p>
                  <p>Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions
                  is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing
                  the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the
                  Package, if you do not accept this license.</p>
                  <p>If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made
                  by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your
                  Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.</p>
                  <p>This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service
                  mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.</p>
                  <p>This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent
                  license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise
                  transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright
                  Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute patent
                  litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party alleging
                  that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then
                  this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation
                  is filed.</p>
