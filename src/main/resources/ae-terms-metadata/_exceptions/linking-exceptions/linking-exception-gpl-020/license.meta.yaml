    - "The exception is that, if you link a SANE library with other files
       to produce an executable, this does not by itself cause the
       resulting executable to be covered by the GNU General Public
       License.  Your use of that executable is in no way restricted on
       account of linking the SANE library code into it"

  excludes:
# this exclude is needed to differentiate between Linking Exception (GPL; variant 019) and Linking Exception (GPL; variant 020)
    - "This exception does not, however, invalidate any other reasons why
       the executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public
       License.

       If you submit changes to SANE to the maintainers to be included in
       a subsequent release, you agree by submitting the changes that
       those changes may be distributed with this exception intact"
