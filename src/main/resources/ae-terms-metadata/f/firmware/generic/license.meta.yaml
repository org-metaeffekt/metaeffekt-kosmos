canonicalName: Firmware License
category: Firmware
shortName: Firmware

# FIXME-IMPLEMENT: this is not precise; this license is rather a concept than a concrete license; check also other cases;
#  - move this license to Binary Firmware License; check patent situation; check license template; excludes
#  - derive a generic and unspecific Firmware License (in the same category)
# FIXME-DISCUSS: ISSUE - "Binary Firmware License" could not be found. License text very similar to BSD 3-Clause License. Wouldn't it make sense to derive a marker instead of a generic and unspecific Firmware License? Many mismatches caused by canonicalName - renaming would be good.
otherIds:
  - "scancode:binary-linux-firmware"

# deactivated because it causes too many mismatches. Would make sense if the license was "(undefined)"
#alternativeNames:
#  - "Firmware License"
