# FIXME-CONCEPT: this modifier causes an incomplete match when matching a text containing
#   "you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
#    Free Software Foundation"
#  The partial match detection does not work; since this is not an evidence match on the "GNU General Public License (undefined)"-level
#  What about marking this license here to produce an incomplete match and the the incomplete match can be "ignored" when
#  a specified set of licenses are matched licenses are matched.
