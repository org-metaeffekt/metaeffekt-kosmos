canonicalName: Firmware License
category: Firmware
shortName: Firmware

# FIXME-IMPLEMENT: this is not precise; this license is rather a concept than a concrete license; check also other cases;
#  - move this license to Binary Firmware License; check patent situation; check license template; excludes
#  - derive a generic and unspecific Firmware License (in the same category)
# in the end two TMDs exist:
#  Firmware License (generic, no license text)
#  Binary Firmware License (this license text and evidences)
otherIds:
  - "scancode:binary-linux-firmware"

# deactivated because it causes too many mismatches. Would make sense if the license was "(undefined)"
#alternativeNames:
#  - "Firmware License"
