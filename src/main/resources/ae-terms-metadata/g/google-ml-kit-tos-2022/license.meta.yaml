    - "As a result, you can use our APIs for processing data that should not leave the device"
    - "The ML Kit APIs may contact Google servers from time to time in order to receive things like bug fixes,
       updated models and hardware accelerator compatibility information"
    - "The ML Kit APIs also send metrics about the performance and utilization of the APIs in your app to Google"
    - "Google uses this metrics data to measure performance, debug, maintain and improve the APIs, and detect misuse or

       by applicable law"
