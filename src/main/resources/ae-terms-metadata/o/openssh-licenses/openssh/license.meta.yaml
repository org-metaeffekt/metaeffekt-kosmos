# FIXME-CONCEPT: introduce new system to match multi licenses: program option to define licenses that should be matched
#   during validation (which are included in the license text - corrected segmentation needed); report if
#   expected/defined licenses are matched by each segment - this allows a more detailed report and especially a correct
#   one; customer wants all the relevant details
