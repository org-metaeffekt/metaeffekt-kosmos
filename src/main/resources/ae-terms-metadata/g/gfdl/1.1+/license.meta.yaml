# FIXME-CONCEPT:
#  Problem: we cannot differentiate GNU Free Documentation License 1.1 (or any later version) from more specific variants
#  such as GNU Free Documentation License 1.1 (or any later version; invariants).
#  We need to specify a hierarchy here and select the most specific (as long as the hierarchy is consistent); this
#  is an extension of the unspecific modelling eliminating licenses with undefined version.
