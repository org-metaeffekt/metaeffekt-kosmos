    - "Means of Acceptance Use, Copying, Distribution or Modification By
       Anyone Constitutes Acceptance. Subject to Section 14.1 (concerning the
       special case of certain Governmental Entities) any copying,
       modification, distribution, or use by You of the Program or any
       Software, shall constitute Your acceptance of all terms and conditions
       of this License Agreement"
    - "As a Licensee, You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person
       to use the Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it
       (including any use of Your copy or copies of the Program) unless such
       person has accepted this License Agreement and has become a Licensee
       subject to all its terms and conditions"
    - "You may not make any copy for Your own use unless You have
       accepted this License Agreement and subjected yourself to all its
       terms and conditions"
    - "You may not make a copy for the use of any other person, or
       transfer a copy to any other person, unless such person is a Licensee
       that has accepted this License Agreement and such person is subject to
       all terms and conditions of this License Agreement"
    - "It is not the position of Hacktivismo that copyright law confers
       an exclusive right to use, as opposed to the exclusive right to copy
       the Software. However, for purposes of contract law, any use of the
       Software shall be considered to constitute acceptance of this License
       Agreement. Moreover, all copying is prohibited unless the recipient of
       a copy has accepted the License Agreement. Because each such recipient
       Licensee is contractually obligated not to permit anyone to access,
       use, or secure a copy of the Software, without first accepting the
       terms and conditions of this License Agreement, use by non-Licensees
       is effectively prohibited contractually because nobody can obtain a
       copy of, or access to a copy of, any Software without (1) accepting
       the License Agreement through use, and (2) triggering some Licensee's
       obligation to require acceptance as a precondition of copying or
       access"
