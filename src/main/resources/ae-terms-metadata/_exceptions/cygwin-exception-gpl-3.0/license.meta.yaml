# FIXME-CONCEPT: these GPL references keep the combiner with the GPl 3.0+ from matching. Result should be "GNU General Public License 3.0 (or any later version; with Cygwin Exception (GPL 3.0+))". actual result is: "Cygwin Exception (GPL 3.0+), GNU General Public License 3.0" - after removing the references from this yaml, it is being matched correctly as "GNU General Public License 3.0 (or any later version; with Cygwin Exception (GPL 3.0+))"
